Nanotechnology: Diamonds are for tethers

Robert J. Hamers1

Modified diamond nanowires produce an electrical response on binding to DNA. This gem of a discovery could pave the way to robust biosensors that use electrical signals to detect molecules.

Diamonds may well be a girl's best friend. But some people prefer to sing the praises of their extreme chemical stability, mechanical robustness and tunable electronic properties.
