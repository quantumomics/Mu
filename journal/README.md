# A precise study of the metal-metal-metal contact energy for electronics<sub><i>μ</i><sup><i>n</i></sup><sup><sup></sup></sup></sub>.


Abstract

A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components using electrical conductive tracks, pads and imposed features etched from copper, and gold sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. Components (e.g. capacitors, resistors, diodes, transistors, integrated circuits or active devices) are generally soldered with 


eutectic alloys for soldering, composed of tin (Sn50), lead (Pb82) and sometimes silver (Ag47) or gold (Au79) — especially Sn<sub>63</sub>Pb<sub>37</sub> alloy formula for electronics.
