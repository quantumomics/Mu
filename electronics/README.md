## LED
LEDs or Light Emitting Diode(s) create light by electroluminescence in a semiconductor material. Electroluminescence is the phenomenon of a material emitting light when electric current or an electric field is passed through it - this happens when electrons are sent through the material and fill electron holes. An electron hole exists where an atom lacks electrons (negatively charged) and therefore has a positive charge. Semiconductor materials like germanium or silicon can be "doped" to create and control the number of electron holes. Doping is the adding of other elements to the semiconductor material to change its properties. By doping a semiconductor you can make two separate types of semiconductors in the same crystal. The boundary between the two types is called a p-n junction. The junction only allows current to pass through it one way, this is why they are used as diodes. LEDs are made using p-n junctions. As electrons pass through one crystal to the other they fill electron holes. They emit photons (light). This is also how the semiconductor laser works.

<b>Colours:</b> LEDs have many fabrications for some colour.
- Red and Infrared LEDs are made with GaAs — gallium arsenide.
- Bright Blue is made with GaN — gallium nitride.
- White LEDs are made with YAG, Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> — yttrium aluminum garnet.
- Orange LEDs are made with AlGaInP — Aluminium gallium indium phosphide.

<b>Note:</b> There are also orange, green, blue, violet, purple, ultraviolet LEDs.

## Resistor
Resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. Resistors are common elements of electrical networks and electronic circuits and are ubiquitous in electronic equipment. Resistors can be constructed out of a variety of materials. Most common, modern resistors are made out of either a carbon, metal, or metal-oxide film. In these resistors, a thin film of conductive (though still resistive) material is wrapped in a helix around and covered by an insulating material." Resistors limit the flow of electrons, reducing current. Voltage comes about by the potential energy difference across the resistor. The mathematical answer is that a resistor is a two-terminal electric device which obeys, or you could say enforces, <i>Ohm's law:</i> <b>V = I•R</b>.

<b>Note:</b> A non-linear circuit is an electric circuit whose parameters are varied with respect to Current and Voltage. In other words, an electric circuit in which circuit parameters (Resistance, inductance, capacitance, waveform, frequency etc) is not constant, is called non-linear Circuit.
