The term contact resistance refers to the contribution to the total resistance of a system which can be attributed to the contacting interfaces of electrical leads and connections as opposed to the intrinsic resistance, which is an inherent property, independent of the measurement method. This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as resistance creep. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by William Shockley to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, "Interface resistance", "transitional resistance", or just simply "correction term" are also used. The term "parasitic resistance" has been used as a more general term, where it is usually still assumed that the contact resistance has a major contribution. Experimental characterization Here we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in two-electrode systems (e.g. diodes) and three-electrode systems (e.g. transistors).

A quantum point contact (QPC) is a narrow constriction between two wide electrically conducting regions, of a width comparable to the electronic wavelength (nano- to micrometer). Quantum point contacts were first reported in 1988 by a Dutch group (Van Wees et al.) and, independently, by a British group (Wharam et al.). They are based on earlier work by the British group which showed how split gates could be used to convert a two-dimensional electron gas into one-dimension, first in silicon (Dean and Pepper) and then in gallium arsenide (Thornton et al., Berggren et al.)

<b>Pt<sub>78</sub></b> has electrical resistivity (<i>ρ</i>) — 105.00 nΩ·m (at 20.0 °C), electrical conductivity (<i>σ</i>) — 9.43×10<sup>6</sup> (S/m) at 20 °C, and thermal conductivity — 071.6 W/(m·K).

A thermal boundary resistance (Kapitza resistance) occurs at interfaces between two metals if one of these metals is superconducting. Experiments performed on interfaces of Nb−Cu and NbTi−Cu indicated values of the Kapitza resistance which exceeded the prediction based on the acoustic mismatch theory. In light of these studies it is shown that the thermal boundary resistance must not be neglected in the stability considerations of technical multifilament superconductors.

Solder is basically metal wire with a "low" melting point, where low for our purposes means low enough to be melted with a soldering iron. For electronics, it is traditionally a mix of tin (Sn<sup>50</sup>) and lead (pb<sup>82</sup>). Tin has a lower melting point (231.93 °C) than Lead (327.5 °C), So more tin means a lower melting point.

Eutectic relating to or denoting a mixture of substances (in fixed proportions) that melts and freezes at a single temperature that is lower than the melting points of the separate constituents or of any other mixture of them. Generally, "The eutectic mixture melts at 183°C".

Eutectic alloys for soldering, composed of tin (Sn<sub>50</sub>), lead (Pb<sub>82</sub>) and sometimes silver (Ag<sub>47</sub>) or gold (Au<sub>79</sub>) — especially Sn<sub>63</sub>Pb<sub>37</sub> alloy formula for electronics.

Mylar<sup>®</sup>,

One of the outstanding properties of Mylar® Type C polyester film is its high insulation resistance over a wide temperature range. Of the commonly used dielectrics, only polystyrene and polyethylene exhibit a higher resistivity, but their use is limited by a relatively low softening temperature.


Melinex® and Mylar® polyester films offer superior optical, physical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. ..

Mylar® A films are tough, general purpose films that are transparent in 48 through 92 gauge and translucent in heavier gauges.

The Kapitza resistance and the thermal conductivity of type A Mylar sheets in the temperature range between 1.4 and 2.1 K have been determined. Four sheets with varying thickness from 37 μm to 255 μm, have been tested in steady-state condition. For a small temperature difference (10–30 mK) and heat flux density smaller than 30 Wm−2, the total thermal resistance of the sheet is determined as a function of sheet thickness and bath temperature. The Kapitza resistance is given by RK = (1.28 ± 0.08)T−3 × 10−3 Km2 W−1, and the thermal conductivity, κ = [(8.83 ± 0.75) + (11.73 ± 0.43) × T] × 10−3 Wm−1 K−1.



As with most materials, the AC dielectric strength in kV/mm decreases as the film thickness increases. For instance, 6 µm Mylar® film has a dielectric strength of over 600 kV/mm while 350µm Mylar® has a dielectric strength of about 80 kV/mm at 25°C.


Mylar® polyester film retains good physical proper- ties over a wide temperature range (–70 to 150°C [–94 to 302°F]), and it is also used at temperatures from –250 to 200°C (–418 to 392°F) when the physical requirements are not as demanding. Some physical and thermal properties of Mylar® are summarized in Table.

Mylar® A films have balanced tensile properties and excellent resistance to moisture and most chemicals. They can withstand temperature extremes from -100°F to 300ºF. Mylar® does not become brittle with age under normal conditions, because it contains no plasticizers.
