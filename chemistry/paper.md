Solder is basically metal wire with a "low" melting point, where low for our purposes means low enough to be melted with a soldering iron. For electronics, it is traditionally a mix of tin (Sn<sup>50</sup>) and lead (pb<sup>82</sup>). Tin has a lower melting point (231.93 °C) than Lead (327.5 °C), So more tin means a lower melting point.

Eutectic relating to or denoting a mixture of substances (in fixed proportions) that melts and freezes at a single temperature that is lower than the melting points of the separate constituents or of any other mixture of them. Generally, "The eutectic mixture melts at 183°C".

Eutectic alloys for soldering, composed of tin (Sn<sub>50</sub>), lead (Pb<sub>82</sub>) and sometimes silver (Ag<sub>47</sub>) or gold (Au<sub>79</sub>) — especially Sn<sub>63</sub>Pb<sub>37</sub> alloy formula for electronics.

Mylar<sup>®</sup>,

One of the outstanding properties of Mylar® Type C polyester film is its high insulation resistance over a wide temperature range. Of the commonly used dielectrics, only polystyrene and polyethylene exhibit a higher resistivity, but their use is limited by a relatively low softening temperature.


Melinex® and Mylar® polyester films offer superior optical, physical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. ..

Mylar® A films are tough, general purpose films that are transparent in 48 through 92 gauge and translucent in heavier gauges.





As with most materials, the AC dielectric strength in kV/mm decreases as the film thickness increases. For instance, 6 µm Mylar® film has a dielectric strength of over 600 kV/mm while 350µm Mylar® has a dielectric strength of about 80 kV/mm at 25°C.


Mylar® polyester film retains good physical proper- ties over a wide temperature range (–70 to 150°C [–94 to 302°F]), and it is also used at temperatures from –250 to 200°C (–418 to 392°F) when the physical requirements are not as demanding. Some physical and thermal properties of Mylar® are summarized in Table.

Mylar® A films have balanced tensile properties and excellent resistance to moisture and most chemicals. They can withstand temperature extremes from -100°F to 300ºF. Mylar® does not become brittle with age under normal conditions, because it contains no plasticizers.
