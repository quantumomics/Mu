Abstract
1. Introduction

Gold is an element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In it's purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element.
Characteristics: Gold is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. It is a soft, yellow, metal with a beautiful lustrous sheen. It is the most malleable and ductile of all the elements and a single gram can be beaten into a sheet one square meter sheet of gold leaf.
Pure gold is soft and is usually alloyed with other metals, such as silver, copper, platinum or palladium, to increase its strength. Gold alloys are used to make jewelry, decorative items, dental fillings and coins. The amount of gold in an alloy is measured with a unit called a karat.
Gold is element 79 and its symbol is Au. Though the name is Anglo Saxon, gold originated from the Latin Aurum, or shining dawn, and previously from the Greek. It's abundance in the earth's crust is 0.004 ppm. 100% of gold found naturally is isotope Au-197.
Gold is a precious metal that is associated with wealth, grandeur, and prosperity, as well as sparkle, glitz, and glamour.


Gold: physical properties. Gold is a soft metal with a number of interesting physical properties. Gold is both malleable and ductile. Gold is a heavy metal (density 19.3 g cm-3) and one gram of gold can be hammered out into a thin sheet of gold a metre in area, and just 230 atoms or so thick.


Gold is the first element recognized by man as a metal. Ancient Egypt was the principal gold producing country and maintained that status until ca. 1500 BC. Gold has been valued since ancient times because of its color, its occurrence in the native state, and its non-tarnishing properties. It was established as the standard for currency by Newton in 1717 when he was Master of the Mint in London. Gold Rushes were responsible for creating large cities like San Francisco, Johannesburg, Sydney, and others.


Physical Properties

Gold is one of the metals that can be prepared readily to the highest purity 99.99+% and is the most ductile of all metals. It can be cold drawn to give wires of less than 10 mm diameter, and beaten into gold foil with a thickness of 0.2 mm. Because of its softness, gold can be highly polished. Very thin gold foil is translucent; transmitted light appears blue-green.

What is the texture of silver?
Silver is a chemical element. Its chemical symbol is Ag and atomic number is 47. Silver is a soft, shiny metal that is a good conductor of electricity. Silver is precious metal that has been used for many years to make fine pieces of jewelry, coins, utensils and various pieces of art.

It is used for jewellery and silver tableware, where appearance is important. Silver is used to make mirrors, as it is the best reflector of visible light known, although it does tarnish with time. It is also used in dental alloys, solder and brazing alloys, electrical contacts and batteries.
