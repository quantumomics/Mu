# Resistance
## Definition
The electrical resistance of a circuit component or device is defined as the ratio of the voltage applied to the electric current whichflows through it: If the resistance is constant over a considerable range of voltage, then <b>Ohm's law</b>, <b>I = V/R</b>, can be used to predict the behavior of the material.

"Resistance is the friction in an electrical circuit that controls the flow of current. As per the voltage causes current. When a voltage is present and there is a path (circuit) for electron flow, then there will be a current".
