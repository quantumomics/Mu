# Resistance
## Definition
The electrical resistance of a circuit component or device is defined as the ratio of the voltage applied to the electric current whichflows through it: If the resistance is constant over a considerable range of voltage, then <b>Ohm's law</b>, <b>I = V/R</b>, can be used to predict the behavior of the material.
