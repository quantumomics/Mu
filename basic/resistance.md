# Resistance
## Definition
The electrical resistance of a circuit component or device is defined as the ratio of the voltage applied to the electric current whichflows through it: If the resistance is constant over a considerable range of voltage, then <b>Ohm's law</b>, <b>I = V/R</b>, can be used to predict the behavior of the material.

"Resistance is the friction in an electrical circuit that controls the flow of current. As per the voltage causes current. When a voltage is present and there is a path (circuit) for electron flow, then there will be a current".

<b>Q.1</b>
What are the factors that affect the resistance of a wire?

<b>Answer:</b>
There are several factors that affect the resistance of a conductor:â€”</br>
- material e.g. copper has lower resistance than steel.
- length - longer wires have greater resistance.
- thickness - smaller diameter wires have greater resistance.
- temperature - heating a wire increases its resistance.

<b>Q.2</b>
What is the resistivity of a material?

<b>Answer:</b>
The electrical resistivity of a material is also known as it's <b><i>specific electrical resistance</i></b>. It is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. <b>"A definition of resistivity is the electrical resistance per unit length and per unit of cross-sectional area"</b>.
