## [1.] Thévenin's Theorem
"Any combination of batteries and resistances with two terminals can be replaced by a single voltage source <b>(<i>e</i>)</b> and a single series resistor <b>(<i>r</i>)</b>. The value of <b>(<i>e</i>)</b> is the open circuit voltage at the terminals, and the value of <b>(<i>r</i>)</b> is <b>(<i>e</i>)</b> divided by the current with the terminals short circuited."

Thevenin's Theorem states that it is possible to simplify any linear circuit, no matter how complex, to an equivalent circuit with just a single voltage source and series resistance connected to a load.

The Thévenin-equivalent resistance RTh is the resistance measured across points A and B "looking back" into the circuit. It is important to first replace all voltage- and current-sources with their internal resistances. For an ideal voltage source, this means replace the voltage source with a short circuit.
