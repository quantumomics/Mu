## [1.] Th√©venin's Theorem
"Any combination of batteries and resistances with two terminals can be replaced by a single voltage source <b>(<i>e</i>)</b> and a single series resistor <b>(<i>r</i>)</b>. The value of <b>(<i>e</i>)</b> is the open circuit voltage at the terminals, and the value of <b>(<i>r</i>)</b> is <b>(<i>e</i>)</b> divided by the current with the terminals short circuited."
